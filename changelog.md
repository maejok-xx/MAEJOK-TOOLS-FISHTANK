# MAEJOK-TOOLS CHANGE LOG

# ***v2.4.7 / 2.4.8***
### Notes
 - 2.4.7 to 2.4.8 is because I'm an idiot and updated code without testing JUST before pushing 2.4.7
 - This update is just bugfixes and a little code refactoring
 - Made dense chat a little less dense...might make density customizable in settings at another date

### Bug Fixes
 - Fix global mission button showing through in Mid/BigChat on reload with Persist BigChat enabled
 - Fix chat modes toggling when opening/saving settings
 - Fix countdown timer setting not working correctly
 - Fix custom setting values not saving (chatters threshold, update check frequency, etc)

### Features Added
 - N/A

 ### Removed
 - N/A

# ***v2.4.6***
### Notes
 - The new "MidChat" mode will break to BigChat around 1200px due to how the site handles sizing of the chat window, however, you'll still be in MidChat mode if you resize down below 1200ishpx, so you'll still need to toggle twice to get back to normal mode...this is not a bug! Don't @ me about this.

### Bug Fixes
 - N/A

### Features Added
 - Settings tab to edit "Friends" and "Watched" users and their corresponding highlight colors.  Google HEX or RGBA color generator to find colors.
 - Ability to customize Friends and Watched Users message highlight colors
 - Updated BigChat to now have a "MidChat" mode. Toggle once for MidChat, twice for BigChat, and thrice to go back to the original layout.

 ### Removed
 - N/A

# ***v2.4.4***
### Notes

 - Chatter count now resets when you change chat rooms

### Features Added

 - "Help" links in settings to help explain what each option does
 - Update checks now run periodically (disable checks or change check frequency in settings)
