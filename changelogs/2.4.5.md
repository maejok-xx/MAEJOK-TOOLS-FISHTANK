# MAEJOK-TOOLS v2.4.4/v2.4.5 CHANGE LOG

### Notes
 - Cleaned up settings Panel
 - leaving change log for 2.4.4 here since most people probably didn't update yet
 - This update is mostly to get the update system finished, and to clean up and refactor some code, and most importantly, to put a notice in place not to bother Wes (fishtank developer) with any bugs or issues created by me distributing this plugin.

### Bug Fixes
 - Issue with user message highlighting persistence (you'll need to reselect any previously highlighted users)
 - Mobile navigation bar showing and XP bar being messed up while in Big Chat while at low resolutions
 - Chatter count now resets when you change chat rooms

### Features Added
 - These change logs
 - Agreement not to bother Wes with bugs created by using this plugin
 - Click chatters count to show the users.  Click the name to tag them.
 - Big Chat state now persists between reloads and resets to whatever state it was in when you left the site/refreshed (configurable in settings)
 - "Help" links in settings to help explain what each option does
 - Update checks now run periodically (disable checks or change check frequency in settings)

 ### Features Removed
 - None
